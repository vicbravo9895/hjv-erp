# Task 4 Implementation Summary: Enhanced FormFieldResolver with Contextual Help

## Overview
Successfully implemented contextual help and field restriction explanations for the FormFieldResolver system, improving user experience by providing clear feedback about field visibility and editability restrictions.

   - Indicates required fields
   - Role-specific guidance

### Technical Implementation

1. **Consistent Messaging Patterns**
   - Centralized role name formatting
   - Standardized restriction reason templates
   - Reusable helper methods

2. **Flexible Configuration**
   - Support for role-specific help text
   - Conditional field visibility explanations
   - Auto-assignment detection and messaging

3. **Seamless Integration**
   - Works with existing FormFieldResolver

## Files Created

- `app/Filament/Forms/Components/FieldRestrictionPlaceholder.php`
- `app/Filament/Forms/Components/ContextualHelpField.php`
- `app/Filament/Forms/Components/EnhancedFormBuilder.php`
- `resources/views/filament/components/field-restriction.blade.php`

## Files Modified

- `app/Contracts/FormFieldResolverInterface.php` - Added new interface methods
- `app/Services/FormFieldResolver.php` - Implemented contextual help methods
- `app/Filament/Resources/MaintenanceRecordResource.php` - Enhanced mechanic_id field
- `app/Filament/Resources/TravelExpenseResource.php` - Enhanced operator_id and status fields
- `app/Filament/Resources/ProductRequestResource.php` - Enhanced requested_by and status fields

## Testing

All files passed syntax validation with no diagnostics errors.

## Next Steps

The enhanced FormFieldResolver is now ready for use throughout the application. Future resources can easily adopt these patterns by:

1. Using `getFieldWithHelp()` to get comprehensive field information
2. Adding hints and helper text based on field info
3. Using the `EnhancedFormBuilder` for automatic field wrapping
4. Displaying restriction placeholders for hidden fields
