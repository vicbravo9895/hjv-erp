# Task 7 Implementation Summary: Automatic Inventory Updates

## Overview
Successfully implemented automatic inventory updates for product requests with complete audit trail tracking.

## Components Implemented

### 1. InventoryAudit Model (`app/Models/InventoryAudit.php`)
- **Purpose**: Track all inventory changes with complete audit trail
- **Key Features**:
  - Records stock changes with previous and new quantities
  - Tracks change type (received, reversed, maintenance usage, manual adjustment)
  - Links to reference models (ProductRequest, MaintenanceRecord, etc.)
  - Records user who made the change
  - Helper methods for creating audit entries
  - Scopes for querying audit history

### 2. Database Migration (`database/migrations/2025_10_23_224218_create_inventory_audits_table.php`)
- **Table**: `inventory_audits`
- **Fields**:
  - `spare_part_id` - Foreign key to spare parts
  - `change_type` - Type of inventory change
  - `quantity_change` - Amount changed (positive or negative)
  - `previous_stock` - Stock before change
  - `new_stock` - Stock after change
  - `reference_type` - Model class that triggered change
  - `reference_id` - ID of the reference model
  - `user_id` - User who made the change
  - `notes` - Additional information
- **Indexes**: Optimized for querying by spare part and reference

### 3. ProductRequestObserver (`app/Observers/ProductRequestObserver.php`)
- **Purpose**: Automatically update inventory when product request status changes
- **Key Features**:
  - Detects status changes to/from 'received'
  - Increases stock when status becomes 'received'
  - Decreases stock when status changes from 'received' (reversal)
  - Uses database transactions for data integrity
  - Implements row locking to prevent race conditions
  - Duplicate update prevention (checks for recent audit entries)
  - Validates against negative stock
  - Creates audit trail for all changes
  - Comprehensive error logging

### 4. Observer Registration (`app/Providers/AppServiceProvider.php`)
- Registered ProductRequestObserver in the boot method
- Observer automatically triggers on ProductRequest model updates

### 5. SparePart Model Enhancement
- Added `inventoryAudits()` relationship for easy access to audit history

## Business Logic

### Automatic Stock Increase
**Trigger**: Product request status changes TO 'received'
1. Lock spare part row for update
2. Check for duplicate updates (within last 5 minutes)
3. Record previous stock quantity
4. Increase stock by requested quantity
5. Save new stock quantity
6. Create audit trail entry
7. Log the change

### Automatic Stock Reversal
**Trigger**: Product request status changes FROM 'received' to another status
1. Lock spare part row for update
2. Check for duplicate reversals (within last 5 minutes)
3. Record previous stock quantity
4. Validate that reversal won't result in negative stock
5. Decrease stock by requested quantity
6. Save new stock quantity
7. Create audit trail entry
8. Log the change

## Data Integrity Features

1. **Database Transactions**: All stock updates wrapped in transactions
2. **Row Locking**: Uses `lockForUpdate()` to prevent race conditions
3. **Duplicate Prevention**: Checks for recent audit entries before updating
4. **Negative Stock Validation**: Prevents stock from going below zero
5. **Audit Trail**: Complete history of all inventory changes
6. **Error Handling**: Comprehensive try-catch with logging

## Requirements Satisfied

✅ **Requirement 6.1**: Automatic stock increase when product request marked as received
✅ **Requirement 6.2**: Complete audit trail with timestamp and user information
✅ **Requirement 6.3**: Stock reversal when status changes from received
✅ **Requirement 6.4**: Duplicate update prevention
✅ **Requirement 6.5**: Validation for non-negative stock quantities

## Testing Recommendations

To test the implementation:

1. **Basic Flow Test**:
   - Create a product request with status 'pending'
   - Mark it as 'received'
   - Verify stock increased
   - Check audit trail entry created

2. **Reversal Test**:
   - Change status from 'received' to 'ordered'
   - Verify stock decreased
   - Check reversal audit entry created

3. **Duplicate Prevention Test**:
   - Attempt to update same request multiple times quickly
   - Verify only one audit entry created

4. **Negative Stock Prevention Test**:
   - Try to reverse a request when stock is insufficient
   - Verify error is thrown and stock unchanged

## Usage Example

```php
// Create a product request
$productRequest = ProductRequest::create([
    'spare_part_id' => 1,
    'quantity_requested' => 10,
    'priority' => 'high',
    'justification' => 'Need parts for maintenance',
    'status' => 'pending',
    'requested_by' => auth()->id(),
    'requested_at' => now()
]);

// Mark as received - stock automatically increases
$productRequest->update(['status' => 'received']);

// View audit trail
$audits = InventoryAudit::forSparePart(1)
    ->recent(30)
    ->get();

// Reverse if needed - stock automatically decreases
$productRequest->update(['status' => 'ordered']);
```

## Next Steps

The next task (Task 8) will enforce approval permissions for product requests, ensuring only administrators and accountants can approve requests.
